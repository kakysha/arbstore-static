Initially, we see it as the instrument for secure P2P cross-border trade between individuals and small businesses., Later down the road we will explore and construct a model tailored for medium and large businesses.</p>

                                <P> The solution is built on smart contracts which accept programmable 
                                    cryptocurrency as a payment method. Funds are secured in the contract until seller’s obligations are met. At that moment the buyer releases the funds and the transaction is completed atomically. Another scenario which the application supports in the customer journey is the dispute between parties due to false representation of the contract obligations. For that we have added the service of arbiters. The arbiters are real world people with good knowledge, qualifications and with high public reputation. They are agreed upon by the contract’s parties when they sign and they can be called to look into the case and decide the outcome of the dispute based on the contract’s text and evidence provided by the parties. </P>
